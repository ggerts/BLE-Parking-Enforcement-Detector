# Parking Enforcement Detector

 The BLE inspector project was motivated by the desire to develop a creative technological solution for monitoring the status of a parked vehicle in a limited duration free-parking zone. The solution to this problem could allow a vehicle to park for the maximum possible duration while eliminating the risk of ticketing. The approach to the problem was to utilize a Raspberry Pi (RPI) computer powered by a cell-phone power bank for monitoring, and transmission, of relevant Bluetooth signals within the proximity of the vehicle. All code was written in Python and Pybluez was the library used for all Bluetooth functionality. The result of this project is a functioning prototype that acts as a proof of concept.
